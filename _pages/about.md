### **About Me**
Hi there! I completed my Master of Science in Computer Science degree from [UC San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/) in June 2023, specializing in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. I'm passionate about Machine Learning and have a keen interest in sequential data such as NLP, speech, time series and my experiences have led me to working with different modalities of data. At UCSD, I worked at [Shang Data Lab](https://shangjingbo1226.github.io/lab/) under [Prof. Jingbo Shang](https://shangjingbo1226.github.io/) to enhance few-shot entity recognition through multimodal language models and graph neural networks in the field of document image understanding.

I currently work as a Data Scientist at [Wiliot](https://www.wiliot.com/). At my current role, I'm developing custom end-to-end ML pipelines using IoT sensor data. These models and Wiliot IoT Pixels are strategically influencing some of the largest retailers in the US significantly. In the summer of 2022, I was a Data Scientist Intern at Apple in the Ad Platforms Data Insights team where I worked on time series clustering models for budget utilization analysis. Before I joined UCSD, I worked at [LEAP Lab](http://leap.ee.iisc.ac.in/), IISc with [Prof. Sriram Ganapathy](http://www.leap.ee.iisc.ac.in/sriram/) on speaker verification and diagnostics of COVID-19 using speech and respiratory sounds ([Project Coswara](https://coswara.iisc.ac.in/)).

### **Misc.**
Besides this, I'm a huge sports buff and love music. Always open to any conversations on cricket, football, tennis and F1! During the pandemic, I finally got around uploading some song covers on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9t_wItiUkZ5-sLKnLLTC5Q). I also enjoy running and hiking. In the October of 2023, I completed my first half marathon! Doing a full marathon is in my bucket list!
