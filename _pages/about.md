### **About Me**
Hi! I'm a Masters in Computer Science student at [UC San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/) specializing in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. Specifically, my interests are in NLP and speech. I currently work with [Prof. Jingbo Shang](https://shangjingbo1226.github.io/) on document image understanding. Before I joined UCSD, I worked at [LEAP Lab](http://leap.ee.iisc.ac.in/), IISc with [Prof. Sriram Ganapathy](http://www.leap.ee.iisc.ac.in/sriram/) on speaker verification and diagnostics of COVID-19 using speech and respiratory sounds ([Project Coswara](https://coswara.iisc.ac.in/)). 

Besides this, I'm a huge sports buff and love music. Always open to any conversations on cricket, football, tennis and F1! During the pandemic, I dabbled in uploading some of my music on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9t_wItiUkZ5-sLKnLLTC5Q). I also enjoy running and hiking. Doing a full marathon is in my bucket list
